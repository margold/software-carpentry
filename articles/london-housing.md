A neighbour stopped by earlier today, looking to collect ammunition against an impending rent increase by asking everybody else in the building how much they currently pay.

We chatted a bit and I told her I was moving out in two months. She mentioned a bit of folk wisdom that I haven't thought of so far, namely that rents rise sharply coming up to September because of the start of the academic year, and fall again October-ish. It does make sense, but I wanted to look at the data. Here goes:

[Monthly rental indices](http://www.home.co.uk/guides/rental_prices_indices/toc.htm):
- Agreed Rent
    - LSL
    - Rent Index (no current data)
    - HomeLet
- Asking Rent
    - Zoopla
    - Move with Us (can't find data)

**September is marked in orange in all charts**

### 1. LSL Buy-to-Let [Index](https://www.lslps.co.uk/news-and-media/market-intelligence/buy-to-let-index/england-wales-buy-to-let-index) ([alternative link](https://www.your-move.co.uk/buy-to-let-index))
I'm not sure why they're calling it "total annual rents" in the report. It looks like average monthly rents to me, and they do have monthly figures that look similar later in the report. There is clear seasonality averaged across England and Wales:

As well as clear seasonality in London. Sort of.

But the rent rise is **in October/November** rather than September. And it's **not very dramatic - about Â£20** all in all.

### 2. HomeLet [Rental Index](https://homelet.co.uk/homelet-rental-index/london)

According to the HomeLet Index, rents rise sometime between June and September. Or rents in more expensive properties do - their sample contains more expensive apartments.

I want to contrast it with a flatshare sample, to see if it has more of a student-induced effect, but Spareroom [isn't publishing data](https://www.spareroom.co.uk/rentalindex) anymore.
