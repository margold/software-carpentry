A neighbour stopped by earlier today, looking to collect ammunition against an impending rent increase by asking everybody else in the building how much they currently pay.

We chatted a bit and I told her I was moving out in two months. She mentioned a bit of folk wisdom that I haven't thought of so far, namely that rents rise sharply coming up to September because of the start of the academic year, and fall again October-ish. It does make sense, but I wanted to look at the data. Here goes:

[Monthly rental indices](http://www.home.co.uk/guides/rental_prices_indices/toc.htm):
- Agreed Rent
    - LSL
    - Rent Index (no current data)
    - HomeLet
- Asking Rent
    - Zoopla
    - Move with Us (can't find data)

**September is marked in orange in all charts**

### 1. LSL Buy-to-Let [Index](https://www.lslps.co.uk/news-and-media/market-intelligence/buy-to-let-index/england-wales-buy-to-let-index) ([alternative link](https://www.your-move.co.uk/buy-to-let-index))
I'm not sure why they're calling it "total annual rents" in the report. It looks like average monthly rents to me, and they do have monthly figures that look similar later in the report. There is clear seasonality averaged across England and Wales:

As well as clear seasonality in London. Sort of.

But the rent rise is **in October/November** rather than September. And it's **not very dramatic - about £20** all in all.

### 2. HomeLet [Rental Index](https://homelet.co.uk/homelet-rental-index/london)

According to the HomeLet Index, rents rise sometime between June and September. Or rents in more expensive properties do - their sample contains more expensive apartments. But the difference here is the same, about £20.

I want to contrast it with a flatshare sample, to see if it has more of a student-induced effect, but Spareroom [isn't publishing data](https://www.spareroom.co.uk/rentalindex) anymore.

### 3. A small aside: VOA Private Rental Market [Statistics](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/private-rental-market-statistics)

Government-issues VOA statistics don't have by-month prices, but do give annual prices by-borough for different kinds of properties. I'm pretty sure the spread is not significant enough, but want to take a look anyway.

![Alt text](../images/voa-2bed-borough.png?raw=true "VOA 2-bedroom London")

I'm using the 2-bedroom dataset from VOA containing rents for the April 2016 to March 2017 period. My picks pre-data were Lambeth and Southwark below the river, and Westminster, Camden and Islington above the river, with an upper budget of £2000 per month. Surprisingly, the upper quartile in Lambeth and Southwark looks like the average rent I saw for the properties there last week. Looking at the methodology, the VOA dataset includes both prices of existing and new rental agreements (and assumes that a price stays stable for 18 months after it's been collected) (see "Prices" in the [Methodology section](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160106022839/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/hpi/index-of-private-housing-rental-prices/historical-series/iphrp-article.html#tab-Methodology-of-IPHRP)), although it does exclude social housing. This way it's not usable for determining prices I will see on the market, but regardless, the price spread within a borough, and relative differences between boroughs should stay similar. I can see that if I would consider Greenwich, I would save £300 per month - that's £10 per day. **Am I willing to pay £10 per day to shorten my commute by 30 minutes each way?** Moving even farther out doesn't seem to make a difference in rents: most outer London stops at £1100.

### ONS indices comparison

But back to the question of seasonality. ONS [discusses the difference](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/articles/comparingmeasuresofprivaterentalgrowthintheuk/aprtojune2017) between private and public indices and also concludes that the higher volatility in the private sector indices is due to including new lets only, as opposed to also including rents that existing tenants are paying. Head over to the webpage for the nicer interactive version of the chart, and Countrywide new lets data that looks similar to HomeLet and LSL so I'm not including it here.

### In conclusion

Month-by-month variations can contribute as little as 1% or as much as 2% to a new let, depending on which index you trust. With a budget of £2000 per month, it's **a difference of £20-£40 per month**. LSL records an over 5% spike for August 2016 (which they do explain with an influx of students!) - that's a difference of £100 - but it's the only such spike I see. All three (HomeLet, LSL, and Countrywide) record a difference of 2-5% between the highest and the lowest seasonal rent.

**Delaying the move-in date by 2 weeks or a month to potentially save £20 pounds isn't worth it**, unless you can wait for much longer in the first place. The best prices seem to be at the start and end of the year, but the exact month depends on what index you trust.
